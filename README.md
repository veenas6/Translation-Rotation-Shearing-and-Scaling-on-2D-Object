# 🧭 2D Transformations on a Triangle (Java Graphics)

This Java program visually demonstrates **2D geometric transformations** on a triangle — including **translation, scaling, rotation, and shearing** — using the `Graphics2D` class from AWT and Swing libraries.

---

## 🎯 Features

* Draws an original triangle (Blue)
* Applies and displays:

  * **Translation** (Green)
  * **Scaling** (Orange)
  * **Rotation** around the triangle’s centroid (Red)
  * **Shearing** in both X and Y directions (Purple)
* Shows all transformations simultaneously for clear comparison.

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used

* **Java AWT** (for rendering graphics)
* **Java Swing** (for GUI window handling)
* **Graphics2D API** (for advanced drawing and transformations)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Open the project in any Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or VS Code with Java extension).
2. Save the file as **TransformTriangleAll.java**.
3. Compile and run:

   ```bash
   javac TransformTriangleAll.java
   java TransformTriangleAll
   ```
4. A window will appear displaying the triangle and its transformed versions.
